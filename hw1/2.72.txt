A.
This is because size_t is unsigned. Even though maxbytes is signed, the expression maxbytes-sizeof(val) is 
interpreted as unsigned as a result. Unsigned numbers will always be more than 0, so this expression is always true.

B.
A rewrite could be 

if ((int) (maxbytes - sizeof(val)) >= 0))

Which would work as the bit pattern is then cast as a signed integer which can be less than 0.
